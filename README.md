### Port Forwarding (YOU NEED THIS, TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE INTERNET(only for servers/pcs at home):
- If You don't know How: Google: YourRouterBrand + Portforwarding
- 27015 UDP - Default Game Port, this one is needed to be forwarded in your Router
- 27015 TCP - QueryPort default, in theory the QueryPort should not be needed as PortForward
